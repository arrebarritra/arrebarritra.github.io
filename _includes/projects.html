    <h3>Vulkan raytracer: a physically based path tracer utilising hardware ray tracing</h3>
    <p>
      In order to learn the Vulkan API as well as get a deeper understanding of light transport theory I implemented a path tracer in Vulkan.
      It takes advantage of raytracing hardware by using Vulkan raytracing extensions.
      It uses the Cook-Torrance BSDF model with physically based constituent functions.
      Multiple features and algorithms are implemented, including multiple importance sampling with material sampling and direct light sampling, rough reflections and refractions, and volume transmission.

    <h3>Approximate opacity optimisation</h3>
    <p>
      My master's thesis project was on approximate opacity optimisation,
      which is a rendering technique that helps reveal important features in dense 3D datasets where there is a lot of occlussion.
      I compared different approximation with regards to their effect on execution time and their accuracy.
      The image shows how opacity optimisation reveals and highlights the important data at the vortex of a tornado.

    <h3>Isosurface renderer with spatial acceleration structure</h3>
    <p>
      For my advanced graphics course I implemented a isosurface renderer that uses implicit kD-trees to accelerate ray traversal for isosurface rendering
      (based on <a href="https://www.sci.utah.edu/~wald/Publications/2005/iso/tcgv.pdforiginal">this</a> and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5290773">this</a> paper).
      The implicit kD-tree is a data structure that partitions the volume data and stores minimum and maximum density values.
      Both the kD-tree construction and rendering is done on the GPU using compute shaders, minimising data transfers.
      The image shows how regions of the volume can be skipped as the ray traverses deeper levels of the tree.

    <h3>Soft Body Simulation on GPU</h3>
    <p>
      This was my final project for my course in Graphics and Interaction, and what really sparked my interest in GPU/graphics programming.
      It is a particle based soft body simulation based on <a href="https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/XPBD.pdf">MÃ¼ller's XPBD</a> method, 
      simulating the system by solving a set of volume and length constraints in every time step.
      One of the most interesting parts of the project was optimising it for parallelisation on the GPU,
      which involved clustering the particles using graph colouring.
      Check out the <a href="https://arrebarritra.github.io/soft-body-project">blog</a> if you're interested in the details!
      Here are some of the skills and technologies I learnt about in this project:

    <h3>Slice based volume renderer</h3>
    <p>
      This is a personal project I made after learning about volume rendering in my Visualisation course.
      It is a slice based volume renderer.
      One of the challenges in making this was the geometric calculations involved in order to generate view aligned polygons and optimise the renderer.

    <h3>arrend</h3>
    <p>
      Arrend is a long term OpenGL renderer project I have been working on.
      I started it in the summer as I started learning OpenGL.
      The project is quite large in scope and work is still in progress.
      Some current features:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deferred shading, normal mapping, SSAO, SSR</li>
      <li>Model loading with multiple textures</li>
      <li>GUI editor</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rolling Reactions</h3>
    <p>
      Rolling Reactions is a group project I'm part of in my course in Advanced Graphics and Interaction.
      It is a VR experience where you traverse in a wheelchair while overseeing experiments in the lab.
      My main contribution was creating a believable wheelchair experience by creating an interaction system and programming the physics of the wheelchair.
